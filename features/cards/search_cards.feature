  As a user
  I want to search and browse cards

  Scenario: User searches cards index
    Given a logged in user
    And cards with the following attributes:
      | title          |
      | Darth Vader    |
    When I go to the cards page
    And I search for "vader"    
    Then I should see "Vader"

    Given a logged in user
    And cards with the following attributes:

    And I am on the home page

    When I follow "Cards"
    And I fill in "search_box" with "Vader"
    And I press "Search"
    Then I should see "Vader" within "#search_details h2"
